Here is an overview of number of crash occur in 24 hours in 2018 and 2019. Firstly, there are three peaks in the plot: 0:00, 8:00 and 17:00. Commuting peak can be considered as the major reason for peaks at 8:00 and 17:00. The reason for 0:00 will be explored in details later. Secondly, we assume that Lighting Conditions, Road Descriptor, and Crash Descriptor are highly correlated with the hour in a day. The following bar plots examine each variable independently with time. Also Collision_Detail will be used to see what the actual reasons for crashing in each hour. Lighting Condition The variation for lighting condition matches time. During day time, the majority cases are under daylight; and during evening, majority cases are under Dark-Road Lighted/Unlighted condition. For crashes happened in the night, the proportion of lighted condition are always higher than the proportion of unlighted condition. On the other side, 17:00 is when most crashes happened during one day, which is under daylight condition in most of the time. Therefore, we can simply conclude that the reason of evening crashes is not correlated with the lighting condition. Road Descriptor The assumption for road descriptor is that during night curve conditions may have more cases than straight conditions. However, the plot indicates that the road descriptor doesnt have a obvious correlation with time. In one day, most of the cases were under the straight and level condition, which is the major condition of most of the road in the states. Damage Severity Most of the crash in these two years are property damage accident. Injury accidentm, property damage &amp; injury accident, and property damage accident have similar distribution through all the time during one day. The proportion of fatal accident is very small, but always happened during night and early morning. Collision Details There are total 30 levels for collision details, which is hard to illustrate in one plot. In the previous data cleaning part, collision details has a super class, collision type, which only have 3 levels (Collision With, Collision With Fixed Object, Non-Collision). The majority cases are under type collision with, so the first plot only contains the collision details that belongs to type collision with, and the second plot shows the top 6 levels in collision details for the remaining types Non-Collision and Collision With Fixed Object. For collision with subject, motor vehicle collisions are over 50% of the cases, which doesnt have a obvious correlation with time. The second highest proportion is collision with animal, which has a peak in the morning around 5:00 and remains low proportion during day time. The animal activity and human activity can explain this phenomenon. Usually, animal activate when human activity reduces, which is during night and early morning. Other collision details, such as collision with bicyclist and pedestrain are not correlated with time. As the plots shown below, details in both types are not have a correlation with the time. Details will be used in the follwing section to explore with other variables. 5.1.2 Month of Year The bar plots above shows the number of car crashes occurred on each month accumulating 2018 and 2019. While the differences between each month are not tremendous, we could still observe that the number of crashes that happened in October, November, December and January are higher than the other months in a year. Remarkably, the four months that have highest number of car crashes occurred are cluster together, and these four months covers almost the whole winter season. Considering the season factor, the weather conditions are different in winter than other season, and the daytime are shorter in winter which the lighting condition could be different as well. To get further information for car crashes that occurred in these four months, we will visulize through the mosiac plots between months and lighting conditions and weather conditions. Looking at the two plots above, for the first plot, we can obverse that for the car crashes that occurred during October, November, December and January, the proportion of having lighting conditions of Dark-Road Lighted and Dark-Road Unlighted when crashes occurred are higher than those in the other months. While most of the crashes happened under the Daylight lighting condition, it is still worth noticing that how the proportion of lighting condition changed when the crashes occurred within these four months. In addition to seeing the lighting conditions, in the second plot showing the proportion of weather conditions when the car crashes occurred, we can observe that around 10 to 18 percent of car crashes occurred in November, December and January are under the Snow or Sleet/Hail/Freezing Rain weather condition. Since the weather condition vary objective to the time period (season) during a year, we cannot infer weather the higher number of crashes in these four months are due to change in the weather conditions. 5.2 Where 5.3 How Top 10 Crashes Detail Within the dataset, there is a variable providing the details of each crash case which give us the information of the type of collision. In total, there are 30 different situations. We pick the top 10 types which take over 80 percents of all crashes that occurred for analysis. According to the bar plot above, more than 70 percent of the crashes are collision with other motor vehicle and the following by collision with subject including Animal, Pedestrian, Bicyclist and fix objects such as Tree, Guide Rail and Sign Post. Road Surface patterns correspond to these top 10 type of Crashes Combination: Lighting Conditions and Road Surface Condition Traffic Control Condition "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
