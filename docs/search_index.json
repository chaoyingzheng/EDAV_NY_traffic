Up to 2019, the population motor-vehicle death rate in the United States was 11.9 per 100,000 population. Indeed, road crashes are the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people aged between 1 and 54. Instead of the whole country, we will focus on studying the traffic accidents happened in New York State specifically, considered that motor vehicle traffic injuries are not only the leading cause of injury related death, but also the second leading cause of injury related hospitalizations and third leading cause for injury related emergency department visits in New York State. Stated by the NY State government, on average, three New Yorkers die every day due to traffic-related cars. While none of us can completely protect ourselves against the odds of being in an auto accident, simple awareness of the danger can help us all remain safer on the roads. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, we will try figuring out the answers the problems related to traffic accidents that are stated in the following section. We believe discover can help people building up their awareness, leading to decline in motor vehicle crashes. 1.2 Problem Statement Where and When car crashes happen the most in New York? Which month in a year, which day in a week, etc. For example, is there a day in the week that a motor vehicle crash is more likely to happen? What are the most frequent events (reasons) of motor vehicle crashes? What are the common patterns of the road, light and weather conditions? What’s the correlation between these variables? "],["data.html", "Chapter 2 Data 2.1 Data Sources 2.2 Column Descriptions 2.3 Issues With the Dataset", " Chapter 2 Data 2.1 Data Sources Data: Motor Vehicle Crashes - Case Information: Three Year Window Source: https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Motor-Vehicle-Crashes-Case-Information-Three-Year-/e8ky-4vqe The dataset we used are coming from the New York State government data website (www.data.ny.gov), specifically provided by the NYS Department of Motor Vehicles(DMV). Note that all crash reports processed by law enforcement personnel are forwarded to the NYS DMV for processing. The NYS Vehicle and Traffic Law require that the parties involved in any crash where injury or death occurred, or property damage in excess of $1,000 results, file a motorist crash report with the DMV. Hence, this data contains that received from both the law enforcement and motorist crash reports filed with DMV. In terms of the contents, the data provides statewide information about the location, environment conditions, detailed time period and event descriptions for each car crash. For time period, this data set included the data within a two years window from 2018 to 2019. 2.2 Column Descriptions The raw vehicle crashes data set contains of 881,617 observations with 18 variables, including the following: Year: Calendar year of incident. A 4-digits number, which is either “2018” or “2019” for the given time period. Crash Descriptor: Categorical variable, it is the reported injury or damage outcome of crash. Including “Property Damage &amp; Injury Accident”, “Fatal Accident”, “Injury Accident” and “Property Damage Accident”. Time: The specific time during the day of the car crashes, in the 24-hours format. Date: The specific date for when car crashes occured, in the format of “MM/DD/YYYY”. Day of Week: Categorical variable, “Monday”, “Tuesday”, “Wednesday”… Police Report: Categorical variable, “Y” or “N”, indicating whether police crash report is on file. Lighting Conditions: Categorical variable for the lighting conditions at time of crash. Municipality: Categorical variable that shows the municipality of crash location. Collision Type Descriptor: Categorical variable that shows the collision manner type, such as “Overtaking”, “Sideswipe”, “Rear End”… County Name: Specific county in New York State where the crash occurred. Road Descriptor: Road description where the crash occurred, categorical. Weather Conditions: Categorical variable of reported weather conditions when the crash occurred, including “snow”, “rain”, “cloudy”… Traffic Control Device: Reported traffic control device present where the crash occurred, such as “Traffic Signal” and “Stop Sign”. Road Surface Conditions: Categorical variable of report road surface conditions when the crash occurred, for example “Dry”, “Snow/Ice”, “Wet”… DOT Reference Marker Location: Department of Transportation reference marker present at location of crash. Pedestrian Bicyclist Action: Categorical variable of the Pedestrian Bicyclist Action at the time of the crash, if applicable. Event Descriptor: String variable of the reported description of the crash event. Number of Vehicles Involved: Numeric variable of the number of vehicles involved in the crash. 2.3 Issues With the Dataset With description for all 18 variables above, we can see that the data provides plenty of information regarding each case. Base on the problem statement and our study goals, not all variables will be useful, so some irrelevant variables are dropped before proceeding to the analysis.

"],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values There is no obvious missing pattern that will affect the analysis in our dataset. Some columns have value as “Unknown” or “Not Applicable”, which is considered as a valid entry instead of missing value. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 When 5.2 Where 5.3 How 5.4 Appendix", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 When 5.1.1 Time in Day First, we explore when crashes happen the most, and the corresponding reasons. Here is an overview of number of crash occur in 24 hours in 2018 and 2019. Firstly, there are three peaks in the plot: 0:00, 8:00 and 17:00. Commuting peak can be considered as the major reason for peaks at 8:00 and 17:00. The reason for 0:00 will be explored in details later. Secondly, we assume that Lighting Conditions, Road Descriptor, and Crash Descriptor are highly correlated with the hour in a day. The following bar plots examine each variable independently with time. Also Collision_Detail will be used to see what the actual reasons for crashing in each hour. Lighting Condition The variation for lighting condition matches time. During day time, the majority cases are under daylight; and during evening, majority cases are under Dark-Road Lighted/Unlighted condition. For crashes happened in the night, the proportion of lighted condition are always higher than the proportion of unlighted condition. On the other side, 17:00 is when most crashes happened during one day, which is under daylight condition in most of the time. Therefore, we can simply conclude that the reason of evening crashes is not correlated with the lighting condition. Road Descriptor The assumption for road descriptor is that during night curve conditions may have more cases than straight conditions. However, the figure Road Descriptor of Car Crashes in Appendix indicates that the road descriptor doesn’t have a obvious correlation with time. In one day, most of the cases were under the straight and level condition, which is the major condition of most of the road in the states. Damage Severity Most of the crash in these two years are property damage accident. Injury accident, property damage &amp; injury accident, and property damage accident have similar distribution through all the time during one day. The proportion of fatal accident is very small, but happened during night and early morning more often. See figure Damage Severity of Car Crashes in Appendix. Collision Details There are total 30 levels for collision details, which is hard to illustrate in one plot. In the previous data cleaning part, collision details has a super class, collision type, which only have 3 levels (“Collision With”, “Collision With Fixed Object”, “Non-Collision”). The majority cases are under type “collision with”, so the first plot only contains the collision details that belongs to type “collision with”, and the second plot shows the top 6 levels in collision details for the remaining types “Non-Collision” and “Collision With Fixed Object”. For collision with subject, motor vehicle collisions are over 50% of the cases, which doesn’t have a obvious correlation with time. The second highest proportion is collision with animal, which has a peak in the morning around 5:00 and remains low proportion during day time. The animal activity and human activity can explain this phenomenon. Usually, animal activate when human activity reduces, which is during night and early morning. Other collision details, such as collision with bicyclist and pedestrian are not correlated with time. For collision with fixed object and non-collision cases, there are no correlations with time. See figure in Appendix for details. Details will be used in the following section to explore relationship with other variables. Midnight Peak We notice that an unusual peak at 00:00 in the total number cases time bar plot. At the same time, in the first two variables, at 0:00 25% of the cases are under Unknown, while compare to other time, this proportion is problematic. With the bar chart below, at 00:00:00, the number of cases is extremely higher than other time. For this result, we have the assumption that 00:00:00 is a position to dump cases with unclear time. To prove the assumption, the number of cases at 00:00:00 are replaced by the second largest number in 00:00. The histogram after cleaning this data is shown below, which support the assumption that 00:00 is not a actual crashes peak, and the crash is highly correlated with human activity. Even though the time of some cases is not accurate, but we decided not to remove them from the following analysis. 5.1.2 Month of Year The bar plots above shows the number of car crashes occurred on each month accumulating 2018 and 2019. While the differences between each month are not tremendous, we could still observe that the number of crashes that happened in October, November, December and January are higher than other months in a year. Remarkably, the four months that have highest number of car crashes occurred are cluster together, which cover almost the winter season. Considering the season factor, the weather conditions are worse in winter than other seasons, and the daytime are shorter in winter so the lighting condition will responsible for more cases. To get further information for car crashes that occurred in these four months, we will visualize through the mosaic plots between months with lighting conditions and weather conditions. In the first plot, we can obverse that for the car crashes that occurred during October, November, December and January, the proportion of having lighting conditions of “Dark-Road Lighted” and “Dark-Road Unlighted” when crashes occurred are higher than those in the other months. While most of the crashes happened under the “Daylight” lighting condition, it is still worth noticing that how the proportion of lighting condition changed when the crashes occurred within these four months. The second plot shows the proportion of weather conditions when the car crashes occurred, we can observe that around 10% to 18% of car crashes occurred in November, December and January are under the “Snow” or “Sleet/Hail/Freezing Rain” conditions. Since the weather condition varies objective to the time period (season) during a year, we cannot infer whether the higher number of crashes in winter are due to change of weather. 5.2 Where New York State covers a total area of 54,555 square miles and contains in total 62 counties. Considering the large area, it is helpful to see further that where the location of car crashes happened more than others. To observe this patterns, we used a map of New York State with boundaries of counties. The graph above shows the number of car crashes that occurred in each county in New York State, where darker color indicates more car crashes in such areas (county). We can obverse that comparing to other counties in NY, the number of car crashes occurred in counties of Manhattan Areas are much larger. More specifically, these counties are Suffolk, Queens, Nassau and Kings. Note that for all car crashes, there are different severity. The measurement we choose to use is one of the variables, Crash Descriptor, which describes the severity of a car crashes. There are four factor levels, in the order of “Property Damage Accident”, “Injury Accident”, “Property Damage &amp; Injury Accident” and “Fatal Accident”. Next, we focus on the fatal accident in each county. The bar plot below indicates that the top 4 counties of fatal accident also the top 4 counties of total car crashes. 5.3 How Top 10 Crashes Detail Within the dataset, Collision Detail provides the details of each crash case, which gives the direct reason of the crash. In total, there are 30 different situations. We pick the top 10 details which take over 80% of all crashes for analysis. According to the bar plot above, more than 70% of the crashes are collision with other motor vehicle and the following by Animal, Pedestrian, Bicyclist and some fix objects such as Utility Pole, Tree, Guide Rail and Sign Post. Traffic Control Condition Traffic control devices acts an important role on help us avoid accidents. These devices gives us important information or warning to keep us safe such as traffic signal, stop signs… We can observe that for car crash occurred when traffic control devices were presented, most of collision with pedestrian, bicyclist and other motor vehicle occurred when traffic signal presented. On the other hand, most of collision with fixed objects including tree, guide rail and earth embankment/rock cut, and animals occurred in No Passing Zone. Interestingly, such patterns we observed are actually confirming the functionality of traffic control devices. Next, we assume that Road surface conditions and lighting conditions are two factors that have correlation with collision details listed above. Correlation of Road Surface and Crashes Details Through the mosaic plot above, we can see that for the top 10 Crashes details, car crashes that have collision with fixed object such as Earth Embankment/Rock Cut, Guide Rail, Tree, Light Support/Utility Pole and Sign Post are more likely to occurred under bad road conditions such as Wet, Muddy, Slush, Flooded Water or Snow/Ice comparing to collision with other motor vehicles, Animals and Bicyclist under the same road surface conditions. Combination: Lighting Conditions and Road Surface Condition The plot above shows the frequency of road surface condition and lighting conditions when car crashes happened. Comparing the intuitive hypothesis that car crashes should occurred more frequent under wet, snow/Ice or even worst road condition, the data shows that actually most of the car crashes accidents occurred under the dry condition. However, it is still noticeable that the number of car crashes occurred under wet or snow/ice condition still be the second and third highest among all. Similar to the road surface condition, the frequency of lighting conditions when car crashes occurred are out of our intuitive expectation. Most of the car crashes occurred under daylight instead of Dusk, Dawn or Dark-Road, which is reasonable if we think deeper since the traffic flow are much higher during the day, active time for human. This is consistent with the results in the previous “When” section. Nevertheless, it worths noticing that the second and third highest lighting conditions when crashes occurred are lighted dark-road and unlighted dark road. Finally, we compare the lighting conditions and road surface conditions and explore their correlation in the plot below. The stair cases in the plot indicates that there is a correlation between these two variables. For car crashes that under the Dark-Road Unlighted condition, more of them are occurring under Muddy and Snow/Ice road surface condition. For car crashes that occurred under Dark-Road Lighted condition, more of them are occurring under Wet and Flooded Water road surface condition. In other words, the combination of the dark unlighted road with muddy surface, is more dangerous than combination of the dark unlighted road with other road surface conditions. 5.4 Appendix ``` "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Introduction 6.2 Interactive", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Introduction In this section, you can explore the frequency of each collision detail, which is also known as the direct reason of car crash. In other words, what type of object or subjects did the vehicles collision with? Or if non-collision, then why the accidents occurred such as “Ran of Roadway”, “Overturned” etc. By clicking the add bar button, the next higher collision detail will appear in the left of the histogram, while the remove bar button will remove the highest bar in the current plot. There are total 30 details in the plot. Notice that the y-axis value will change as the frequency increases or decrease, since the difference between the most frequent and least collision detail is large. Note: After clicking the add bar button up to the point where the highest collision detail showed in the plot, the plot won’t change further by clicking the add bar button. One can keep using the plot by clicking the romove bar button a few times until seeing bars get removed from plot. 6.2 Interactive "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Main Takeaway 7.2 Limitation 7.3 Feature Work", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Main Takeaway According to the exploratory data analysis and visualization from the previous sections, we can conclude that more car crashes occurred at 8 to 9 o’clock in the morning and 4 to 6 o’clock in the afternoon then the other hours, which are the rush hours. In terms of months, October, November, December and January during the winter season, more vehicle accidents are observed comparing to other months. Such results reminding us to be more careful when driving on road during the specified time periods. More specifically, when we taking look deeper regarding the weather conditions, lighting conditions and road surface conditions when an accident occurred, we observed that when driving on a unlighted dark-road, road surface with Muddy and Snow/Ice condition become more dangerous than the other time. While driving on a lighted dark-road, road surface with wet and flooded water become more dangerous. Vehicle drivers should take extra precautions when encountering such combination of lighting and road surface conditions. Nevertheless, it is important to note that most of the car crashes occurred under the daylight and on dry road surface which are “good” condition as one would define instead of bad conditions. Therefore, all drivers should not let their guard down when driving under ideal conditions, which the data reminds us that indeed became the most dangerous situations. New York State, containing 62 counties and around 8.5 million of population, is a state having high population density. Moreover, New York city is the city having the highest population and population density in the US. Reflected by the data, counties in the Manhattan area including Queens, Nassau, Suffolk and Kings, have the most car crashes occurred comparing to other counties in NY. Measured by the severity of the crashes, these four counties also have the highest amount of fatal accidents occurred. Thus, people who would drive in the Manhattan area, specifically in the four counties that have high population density mentioned previously should be more careful. Within the vehicle accidents we observed in the data, around 70% of them are collision with other motor vehicles, followed by collision with animals and other fixed objects. Thus, one should not only taking care of the physical environment around but also should pay more intention on other motor vehicles around when driver on road. Accidents of colliding with other vehicle will involve payoff of more people. Notice that for car crash occurred when traffic control devices were presented, most of collision with pedestrian, bicyclist and other motor vehicle occurred when traffic signal presented. On the other hand, most of collision with fixed objects including tree, guide rail and earth embankment/rock cut, and animals occurred in No Passing Zone. In general, drivers should pay a lot more intention on traffic devices if one presented because they are actually give us useful instruction avoid accidents and keeping us safe. Supported by the data, Violating the instructions given by traffic devices could lead to properties damages, injuries and even life threatening accidents. All in all, people should be careful when driving under high traffic flow time periods, taking care of the overall traffic environment including weather, lighting, road surface conditions and other motor vehicles on roads, as well as paying attention to the traffic device. As what we mentioned at the beginning, none of us can completely protect ourselves against the odds of being in an auto accident, but taking the lesson from the data can help us all remain safer on the roads. 7.2 Limitation Note that the dataset we used for this project contains data received from both the law enforcement and motorist crash reports filed with DMV. DMV is solely the collector of the data, which they do not affect the accuracy of what is reported to them. Since part of the data are coming from self-report files, there could exist some self-report bias within the data. In addition, the data we used is the crash cases data. Indeed, there are three more datasets from DMV which are individual data, vehicle data and violation data for car crashes specifically for the same time period in NY State. However, all these four datasets have different amount of observation which we cannot link the data together based on each case one by one. Considering the consistency issues and the one we are using contains the largest amount of observations which provides the most information and data we need, we didn’t combine the other three datasets all in one. We believe more information relevant to motor vehicle accidents could be found among analysis on those three datasets. 7.3 Feature Work As we mentioned in the limitation part, the other three datasets provided by DMV is still valuable in some way. Further work for this project would include analysis on those three dataset individually, while combining generalize the results together. Through such work, a more comprehensive view about the motor vehicle accidents could be obtained.
