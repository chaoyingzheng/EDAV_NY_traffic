(Todo: x-axis label update to 0:00?) Here is an overview of number of crash occur in 24 hours in 2018 and 2019. Firstly, there are three peaks in the plot: 0:00, 8:00 and 17:00. Commuting peak can be considered as the major reason for peaks at 8:00 and 17:00. The reason for 0:00 will be explored in details later. Secondly, we assume that Lighting Conditions, Road Descriptor, Traffic Control Device, Crash Descriptor and Collision Type Descriptor are highly correlated with the hour in a day. The following histograms will examine this assumption. Also we will use Collision_Detail to see what the actual reasons for crashing in each hour. Todo: analysis, add each cols level in the description/analysis, conclude whether correlated with time Todo (code): x-axis label clean up(rotation or abbreviate), add full name if abbreviate 5.1.2 Day of Week 5.1.3 Month of Year 5.2 Where "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
